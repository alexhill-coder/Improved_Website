# A Webpage Made With HTML, CSS, Bootstrap & JavaScript.

Building upon my previous website [located here](https://github.com/alexhill-coder/Basic_Website) this website was further developed to accommodate additional pages and features such as like/save buttons, ability to leave reviews.

In terms of functionality it is fairly simple there are links at the top/bottom of the screen that allow movement between the html pages with additional links on the index.html to the about and collections page. The website is fully responsive so can be seen on any device.

## How To Use

To use is very simple the website is response and connects to each other, so you can just play around with the dimentions and the links. Below shows the newest arrivals section of the home page. Each item has two buttons located in the top right courner to enable the user to like the item (which carries over from page to page) and the save button that allows the user to display it the saved page part of the site.
